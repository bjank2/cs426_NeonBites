Description
Our project is a 3D game demo set in a cyberpunk-inspired cityscape. Players navigate through the city on a futuristic bike, encountering various challenges and interacting with NPCs along the way. The gameplay focuses on exploration, timely deliveries, and engaging with the dynamic environment.

Components

Forms of 3D Physics
Particle System: The bike features exhaust and turbo effects implemented as particle systems, enhancing the visual feedback during gameplay.
Bike Inclination Calculation: The bike's physics engine calculates inclination based on player actions. Exceeding a threshold causes the player to crash and detach from the bike, adding a realistic element to gameplay. The speedometer as well keeps track of bike's velocity in realtime.
Colliders and Triggers: Various objects utilize colliders and triggers for interactions, such as pickup and drop-off points for deliveries and detecting the player's presence for AI drones as well.

Lights
Headlights: The bike is equipped with headlights, illuminating the player's path and enhancing visibility during nighttime gameplay.
AI Drone Lights: The patrol AI drone emits light that changes according to its current state, aiding in visual feedback for players.
Explosion Light: Explosions generated by grenades emit light, adding realism and enhancing the atmosphere during intense moments.

Textures
Textures are extensively used throughout the game to create a visually immersive environment. Unique textures adorn the bike, NPC characters, buildings, cars, and other environmental assets, enhancing the aesthetic appeal of the cyberpunk-themed world.

Mecanim
Player Controller Mecanim: The player controller implements Mecanim for walk, run, idle, and driving animations, adding fluidity and realism to player movements.
Dance/Punching Mecanim: In the playground scene, players can control the character to perform dance or punching animations, providing entertainment and interaction opportunities.
Enemy Mecanim: Enemies feature their own Mecanim animations, including idle and fighting animations, adding diversity and challenge to encounters.
	All of these are fully rigged characters.

AI Constructs
Pathfinding with NavMesh
The implementation of pathfinding with NavMesh significantly enhances player navigation and exploration within the game world. For example, in the minimap scene, players can interact with the map to generate routes between points of interest. This feature allows players to plan their journeys efficiently, discover hidden locations, and avoid obstacles or hostile areas. Additionally, NPCs and AI drones utilize pathfinding to patrol designated areas or pursue the player, adding dynamic challenges and opportunities for strategic gameplay.

In-World AI NPC (LLM)
The inclusion of an in-world AI NPC enriches player interactions and immersion within the game environment. In the minimap scene, players encounter the NPC owner of a coffee shop. Players can engage in dialogue with the NPC, asking about their order status or engaging in casual conversation. The NPC's responses and actions, such as spawning delivery items or providing hints, contribute to the game's narrative progression and provide meaningful objectives for players to pursue.

FSM Drone AI
The implementation of a Finite State Machine (FSM) for AI drones introduces dynamic behavior and challenges for players to overcome. In the patrol scene, drones exhibit three distinct states: Patrol, Detected, and Fallback. During the Patrol state, drones autonomously navigate predefined routes, surveilling the area for intruders. When the player enters their detection range, drones transition to the Detected state, actively pursuing and engaging the player. If the player manages to evade detection or defeat the drones, they enter the Fallback state, returning to their patrol routes. This dynamic AI behavior adds tension, strategy, and replay value to player encounters, encouraging tactical decision-making and adaptability.

Bayesian Network Attacking
When the customer begins to attack the player for delivering the incorrect order, they attack utilizing a simplified Bayesian Network. The enemy will calculate the probability of deciding to attack based on the condition of their health. The lower their health is, the less likely they are to attack. This is calculated using a threshold for the decision making, to factor in the health when deciding to attack. The enemy will attack frequently in the beginning and then less likely toward the end of their life. 

INSTRUCTIONS: HOW TO RUN - FOR GRADING

Goto folder named '_SCENES'

For the Playground scene:
	this is a customization scene, where you can add accessories to your player or bike. 
	As described on the screen, engage with the controls and arrow keys to switch between accessories. 
	To press next button, you will need to switch mode. Press I to do so. Only then will you see a cursor. 
	Pressing the button will spawn the bike. You will need to goto View mode again to interact with bike. 
	Press L to load the next scene, that is Minimaps scene

For the Minimap scene:
	Play the level and engage with the NPC. You can talk to the NPC about anything. He is a coffeeshop owner. If you want your oreder, you need to ask him if your order is ready. 
	Press E to pickup order. When pickedup, the minimap at top-right will tell you where to deliver it.
	You can ride the bike in the scene, which is at right of where the player starts from. Use the controls as described in the UI screen. Press P to get off the bike.
	
	- To engage with the blue enemy in the scene, press left click to throw a punch. The reaction of the enemy is based on the bayesian network probability. This is meant to be implemented for the customers in our game, which can 	turn hostile, based on probabilities and parameters of our delivery

For the Patrol scene:
	This is a simple indoor scene where an AI Drone is patrolling the area. 
	The drone has 3 states. It will randomly travel around the map in search of player. You can keep track of it on the minimap.
	In order to throw grenade, keep pressing right click, move the mouse and press G together. This will spawn a grenade, which will go off after few seconds.
